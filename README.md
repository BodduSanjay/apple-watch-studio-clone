# Apple Watch Studio Clone

This project is a simple **Apple Watch Studio Clone** that allows users to browse and select Apple Watches, choose from different watch faces, bands, and sizes, and visualize their custom Apple Watch selection. The project includes an image slider with selectable image sizes and integrates with React Context for global state management.

## Features

- **Image Slider**: Users can view different Apple Watch images in two sizes (small and large). They can navigate through the images and select the image size (small or large).
  
- **Global State Management**: The selected image and its size are stored globally using React's Context API. This allows the selected image details to be accessed throughout the application.

- **Responsive Design**: The design is responsive and should work well across different screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

- **Image Selection**: Users can click on either a small or large version of the image, and the selected size will be saved in the global state.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is used to create reusable components like the `ImageSlider` and manage the application state.
  
- **React Context API**: Used to manage global state for the selected image and its size. This eliminates the need for prop drilling and allows the selected image details to be accessed across different components.

- **CSS**: For styling the components and creating a simple, responsive layout for the image slider and buttons.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed. You can download them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Steps to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/apple-watch-studio-clone.git


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
